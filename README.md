# BASIC Snake

This repository contains a simple Snake game implemented in BASIC style. The code is provided in `snake.bas` and can be run with a compatible BASIC interpreter.

Use WASD keys to move the snake around the board and try to eat the food marked with `*`. Hitting the walls or the snake's own tail ends the game.
